# Distance-Based Delays in Echo State Networks
This branch contains the code version and analysis related to 
[the 2022 paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21753-1_21). Since then, several 
changes in 
network design have been made on the main branch, causing problems in reproducing the older results.

Hyperparameter evolution experiment Can be run from [main.py](main.py).

Analysis of results is presented in [the included ipynb](DDN-2022-paper-analysis.ipynb).
